seps525_oled_Library
==============
A library designed to work with the Newhaven NHD‐1.69‐160128UGC3 128x160 pixel OLED display, using the Adafruit GFX library.

this library works, but I have put it on hold for now. 

It is slow when using SPI. I don't know if its the display, or my code, or the interface. I will be attempting to use this again in the future, but I may go the parallel interface route when I re-attempt to increase the bandwidth. 

I am currently using a monochrome 128x64 SSD1306 based display and it is MUCH faster.
